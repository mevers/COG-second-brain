# COG Knowledge Consolidation Power

Transform scattered insights from braindumps, daily briefs, and check-ins into coherent frameworks and "single source of truth" knowledge documents through pattern recognition and systematic synthesis.

For filing, source preservation, discovery and lifecycle, follow `.claude/skills/knowledge-consolidation/SKILL.md`.

Include relevant domain notes, project plans/resources and knowledge/booklets; exclude pending input and `.sources/` originals. Use project lifecycle and `content_status` for active/current views: exclude `outdated` as current evidence and follow `superseded_by` for `superseded` notes. Missing status is unassessed.

## When This Power Activates

- User wants to consolidate their insights
- User mentions "consolidate knowledge", "build frameworks", "synthesize insights"
- Time for periodic knowledge base maintenance
- Before major decisions that could benefit from framework consultation

## Process Flow

### 1. Data Gathering

Scan vault for unprocessed content:
- Braindumps: `02-personal/`, `03-professional/`, `04-projects/*/`
- Daily briefs: `01-updates/briefs/`
- Check-ins: `01-updates/checkins/`
- Project documents: `04-projects/*/planning/`, `04-projects/*/resources/`

Ask user: "What time period should I analyze? (last week, last month, last quarter, all time, custom?)"

### 2. Pattern Recognition

Apply systematic pattern detection:

**Frequency Analysis:** What comes up repeatedly?
- Themes across multiple documents
- Persistent questions or concerns
- Recurring action items or decisions

**Temporal Clustering:** What emerged together?
- Related insights by time period
- Thinking evolution over time
- Inflection points where thinking shifted

**Domain Correlation:** What crosses domains?
- Personal insights affecting professional thinking
- Project experiences informing personal growth
- Strategic themes spanning all domains

**Contradiction Analysis:** Where does thinking conflict?
- Contradictory thoughts or approaches
- Evolution vs. inconsistency
- Perspective shifts over time

### 3. Framework Development

Synthesize patterns into actionable frameworks:

**Identify Core Principles:** What fundamental truths emerge?
**Test Against Evidence:** Do sources support these principles?
**Define Boundaries:** When does this framework apply/not apply?
**Create Applications:** How to use this framework?

### 4. Knowledge Integration

**Update Existing Frameworks:** Add new evidence, refine principles
**Create New Frameworks:** For newly identified patterns
**Document Patterns:** Create pattern analysis files
**Create Timeline Entries:** Track thinking evolution

## Output Locations

- Frameworks: `05-knowledge/consolidated/[framework-name]-framework.md`
- Patterns: `05-knowledge/patterns/pattern-[name].md`
- Timeline: `05-knowledge/timeline/[topic]-evolution-YYYY-MM.md`
- Reports: `05-knowledge/consolidated/consolidation-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### 5. Cleanup and Archival

- Preserve source metadata and prior consolidation backlinks.
- Add consolidation reference: `consolidated_in: "[[consolidation-YYYY-MM-DD]]"`
- Retain superseded guidance in place with `content_status: superseded` and `superseded_by`. If obsolete with no replacement, use `content_status: outdated` without `superseded_by`.

## Framework Status Levels

- **Emerging:** New, needs more evidence
- **Working:** Generally useful, still refining
- **Stable:** Well-established, proven useful

## Quality Guidelines

- **Quality Over Quantity:** Don't force insights that aren't mature
- **Preserve Nuance:** Don't over-simplify complex insights
- **Maintain Traceability:** Always link back to sources
- **Living Documents:** Frameworks should evolve with new insights

## Success Metrics

- Completeness: All relevant insights processed
- Coherence: Frameworks logically consistent
- Traceability: Clear links to source material
- Actionability: Frameworks applicable to decisions
- Evolution: Documented thinking progression
