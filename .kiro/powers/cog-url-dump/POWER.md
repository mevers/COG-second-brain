# COG URL Dump Power

Transform raw URLs into structured, insightful knowledge entries through intelligent content extraction, categorization, and integration with the user's knowledge base.

For filing, source preservation, discovery and lifecycle, follow `.claude/skills/url-dump/SKILL.md`.

## When This Power Activates

- User shares a URL they want to save
- User mentions "save this link", "bookmark this", "url dump", "save for later"
- User pastes a URL and wants to capture it

## Pre-Flight Check

1. Check for `config/MY-PROFILE.md`
2. If found: Read interests and projects for auto-categorization
3. Check existing categories in `05-knowledge/booklets/`

## Process Flow

### 1. Input Collection

Accept URL(s) from user:
- Single URL or batch
- Optional user note about why they're saving it
- Any format: bare URL, markdown link, or with notes

### 2. URL Validation & Fetch

- Validate URL format
- Check if accessible
- Detect duplicates in existing knowledge base
- Fetch web page content

Extract:
- Page Title, Meta Description
- Author, Published Date (if available)
- Word Count, Read Time
- Main Content, Key Headings

### 3. Category Selection

**Default Categories:**
- Articles & Blogs
- Tools & Resources
- Reference & Documentation
- Research & Papers
- Inspiration & Design
- Videos & Media
- News & Updates
- Project-Specific (offer project list)
- To Review (unsure)

Auto-suggest category based on content, let user confirm or change.

### 4. Content Analysis

**Classification:**
- Content Category, Primary Topics, Tone
- Quality Assessment, Credibility Indicators

**Insight Extraction:**
- Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
- Key Insights (3 items with context)
- Notable Quotes, Action Items

**Relevance Assessment:**
- User Interest Match (high/medium/low)
- Project Relevance
- Knowledge Gap filled
- Timeliness (evergreen/current/dated)

### 5. Generate Output

Create structured bookmark file with:
- YAML frontmatter (type, category, url, title, tags, relevance)
- Quick Summary
- Key Insights
- Why This Matters (connection to user's interests)
- Content Highlights
- Practical Takeaways
- Related Knowledge links
- Source Details table

### Tool/Resource Special Template

For tools and software, include:
- What It Does
- Key Features
- Use Cases
- Pricing
- Evaluation Status checklist

## Output Locations

- **Standard:** `05-knowledge/booklets/[category-slug]/[title-slug]-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Project-specific:** `04-projects/[project-slug]/resources/[title-slug]-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Unresolved:** keep original input pending with a reason; no completed mixed-domain note.

## Batch Processing

For multiple URLs, process and report:
```
1. [URL 1] → [category] → Saved to [path]
2. [URL 2] → [category] → Saved to [path]

Summary: X articles, Y tools saved
```

## Confidence Levels

- **High (90%+):** Clear content with obvious categorization
- **Medium (70-89%):** Generally clear with some ambiguity
- **Low (50-69%):** Significant ambiguity requiring user input
- **Very Low (<50%):** Major uncertainty, save to inbox

## Special Cases

- **Paywalled:** Note limitation, extract available preview
- **Dynamic Content:** Note content may change
- **Non-English:** Note language, provide translation if possible

## Task Date Format

Action items use Obsidian Tasks emoji format with calculated due dates:
- **Practical takeaways:** `📅 [date +1 week]`
- **Tool evaluation tasks:** Progressive dates from +3 days to +2 weeks

Example:
```markdown
## Practical Takeaways
- [ ] Try the API integration 📅 2026-02-10

## Evaluation Status
- [ ] Sign up / try demo 📅 2026-02-06
- [ ] Test key features 📅 2026-02-10
- [ ] Decision: [use|pass|revisit] 📅 2026-02-17
```

## Success Metrics

- Speed of capture (< 30 seconds for single URL)
- Accurate categorization with user confirmation
- Useful insight extraction
- Proper integration with existing knowledge
- Easy retrieval and discovery later
