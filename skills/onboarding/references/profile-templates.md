# Profile document templates

Verbatim markdown templates for the four documents created in onboarding Step 6 (Generate Profile Documents). Fill in the bracketed placeholders when generating each file.

## `config/MY-PROFILE.md`

```markdown
---
type: profile
created: YYYY-MM-DD
onboarding_completed: true
role_pack: [matched role_id or "custom"]
agent_mode: [solo or team, based on role pack suggestion]
verification_harness: off
tags: ["#profile", "#config", "#cog"]
---

# My COG Profile

## About Me
- **Name**: [Name]
- **Role**: [Job/role/main activity]
- **Role Pack**: [Display name from matched role pack, or "Custom" if no match]
- **Profile Created**: [Date]

## Settings
- **Agent Mode**: [solo/team] *(solo = handle everything directly; team = delegate to specialist sub-agents for deeper results)*
- **Verification Harness**: off *(off = the V-model harness runs only when you ask for it, e.g. `/closed-loop`; on = build tasks default to the `normal`-lane pipeline)*

## Active Projects
[If they mentioned projects:]
- [[04-projects/[slug]/PROJECT-OVERVIEW|Project Name 1]]
